## Meeting 1 (Sprint #1) - 9/10/19
Today, we held a weekly meeting to discuss the sprint that commenced today. The main 
objective of this meeting was to assign points to the user stories and determine which
stories are most important to focus on for Sprint #1. We decided to focus on user account
creation, event creation and database setup as these are the basis of other features. I
was assigned to work on user facing features with Michael.

What did I do yesterday? Yesterday, I worked on adding all the user stories we have 
decided to complete to the icebox on pivotal tracker. 

What will I do today? Today, I will continue to add tasks and user acceptance criteria
to the pivotal tracker so that we are aware of exactly what we need to complete. I am
also going to work with Michael on completing a user story: Creating an account

Is anything in my way? Some features that are allocated to me rely on interface 
components, since this is the first week of development and we are focusing more on
back-end to get up an running, this may impact my progress on the user stories as part
of sprint one.


## Meeting 2 (Sprint #1) - 14/10/19
Today, we held another weekly meeting for Sprint #1 to discuss the progress of everyone
and bring up any concerns we have. We decided to modify some architecture and enforce
some code styling techniques. 

What did I do yesterday? Yesterday, I worked on account creation and worked on scoping 
what attributes the user class will require for account creation

What will I do today? Today, I will complete the user class, with appropriate functions
as well as implement test cases to ensure that the code works accordingly

Is anything in my way? The react/flask setup is slightly delayed due to other university
commitments which pushes draft UI creation a day further. 


## Meeting 3 (Sprint #2) - 16/10/19
Today, we held a sprint review to discuss the success of Sprint #1 as well as planning
the following sprint that commences tmrw. We worked together to assign stories for the
backlog, assigned tasks and spoke about how to improve the agile process for Sprint #2. 

What did I do yesterday? Yesterday, I on checking and accepting the user stories as part
of Sprint #1 and added tasks to the user stories stages for Sprint #2. I also modified
the interface and created some additional screens to share with the team. I attached
these designs to the corresponding user story.

What will I do today? Today, I will add acceptance criteria to the stories in Sprint #2
and research DialogFlow so that I can complete the NLP user story for this sprint. I also
plan to work on the invitees user story with Michael.

Is anything in my way? Learning NLP before beginning to work on the user story might 
slow down my progress slightly. 


## Meeting 4 (Sprint #2) - 21/10/19
Today, we held a meeting to discuss the end of Sprint #2 as well as planning for the
following sprint. The team again, worked on assigning the user stories.

What did I do yesterday? Yesterday, I worked on setting up the Flask and React file
structure with Morgan. 

What will I do today? Today, I will continue to work on setting up the Flask and React
so that the team and I are able to start creating the front end.

Is anything in my way? Lack of familiarity with Webpack (a resource that we are using)
to set up the file structure may be problematic.



## Meeting 5 (Sprint #3) - 23/10/19
Today, we held a sprint meeting to discuss the user stories we hope to tackle for this
new sprint and assigned tasks to everyone. Egene also updated the team on the progress
of the database so that everyone is on the same page, especially those working on the 
back0end of the application.

What did I do yesterday? Yesterday, I began setting up the calendar UI so that we have
a interface to play around with. This involved setting up a basic calendar view and adding
stub events that we can play around. I also added navigation elements so that we can flip
between the months in the calendar.

What will I do today? I will continue setting up the basic calendar UI and create acceptance
criteria for the user stories.

Is anything in my way? I am having some trouble with the React routing. I believe it has
something to do with the webpack configuration but I will continue to fix the BUG
which I have added to Pivotal Tracker.


## Meeting 6 (Sprint #3) - 28/10/19
Today, we met up to check the status of everyone regarding the progress on the user
stories and tasks. There was some confusion on how to store notifications and when 
notifications should be triggered for users. After some discussion, we arrived at a 
method that satisfied everyone and was user-focused too.

What did I do yesterday? Yesterday, I continued working on the monthly view and set
up buttons to use when the other calendar views are finished.

What will I do today? I will work on adding acceptance criteria and more tasks to 
Pivotal Tracker for the next sprint that will start tomorrow. I will also work on refining
the monthly view so that once real events are loaded in, we can test the front-end.

Is anything in my way? No.



## Meeting 7 (Sprint #4) - 30/10/19
Today, we held our sprint review with the class. We presented the calendar view and 
the login screens that were a part of the previous iterations. 

What did I do yesterday? Yesterday, I worked on creating a universal stylesheet to added.
I also imported the font styles and defined basic colours and headings so that the interface
is consistent. I also worked on the group contact back-end feature with Derrick.

What will I do today? Today, I will work on organising the interface files as more team
members are going to jump on the front end portion of the application soon. I will also
begin the schedule view of the calendar and work on the adding calendars mechanism (both
of which are user stories I am assigned to)

Is anything in my way? Today, we found a bug within the system. The interface was not 
rendering on other teammates computers. I suspect this is because some dependencies have
not been uploaded (from my end). 



## Meeting 8 (Sprint #4) - 4/11/19
Today, we held another meeting to discuss the progress of the database that Egene is in
charge of. We also discussed other questions team mates have regarding their assigned
user stories.

What did I do yesterday? Yesterday, I worked on creating tasks and user acceptance criteria
to the user stories that are upcoming in the next iteration. I worked on attempting to change
the date formats that are rendered in the schedule overview of events but I am finding this 
difficult given I have little experience with Javascript.

What will I do today? Today, I will work on the schedule overview of events. The basic
structure of the interface for the schedule view is already created but requires some 
modifications that require some time. Additionally, I will be working on a method to wire
the schedule view to other components of the system.

Is anything in my way? No.



## Meeting 9 (Sprint #5) - 6/11/19
What did I do yesterday? Yesterday, I worked on setting up the user stories and details for
chores and bugs that we are experiencing on Pivotal Tracker so that everyone is aware of what
needs to be done.

What will I do today? Today, I will work on understanding a bit more of the database so that
I can better route the backend to the frontend and store any changes that are made by the user
on the front-end

Is anything in my way? No


## Meeting 10 (Sprint #5) - 11/11/19
What did I do yesterday? Yesterday, I worked on refining the navigation bar component in react
and converted all of our functional components to general components as they were giving errors
when rendering the front end.

What will I do today? Today, I will work on creating a calendar field when creating and editing
events and refine the design of the creating and editing event modals.

Is anything in my way? No


## Meeting 11 (Sprint #6) - 13/11/19
What did I do yesterday? Yesterday, I worked on completing my assigned chores:
- Displaying current date and time on all calendar views (month, week, day, schedule)
- Create favicon and add logo's to the site 
I also began preparing for the next user stories (added acceptance criteria and chores
to pivotal tracker)

What will I do today? Yesterday, I worked on
- I added a calendar field when making new events
- I created a basic modal to create new contacts and groups and added this to the front end

Is anything in my way? I'm having some difficulty figuring out the routing functions we
are using (as I am assigned to rendering calendars to the front end and that requires this
function) but I will check with other team members for help with that


## Meeting 12 (Sprint #6) - 18/11/19
What did I do yesterday? Yesterday, I worked on
- I created a basic time breakdowns pop-up so that Derrick can paste the time breakdown 
contents there
- I fixed an issue regarding calendar fitting (the calendar viewed differently on different
devices which squished other components)
- I styled the date-pickers so that they view similarly on all devices
- I created a custom event wrapper so that event UI's show time, title and are rendered in
their calendar colours

What will I do today? Today, I will work on rendering error messages for login and registering
as well as create a method to render all a user's calendars onto the front end. I will also
create routes to edit and delete such calendars. 

Is anything in my way? Nothing in particular, mainly deadlines with other assignments.
