## Weekly Meeting 1 (Sprint #1) - 9/10/19
Today, we held a weekly meeting to discuss the sprint that commenced today. The main 
objective of this meeting was to assign points to the user stories and determine which
stories are most important to focus on for Sprint #1. We decided to focus on user account
creation, event creation and database setup as these are the basis of other features. I
was assigned to work on user facing features with Michael.

What did I do yesterday? Yesterday, I worked on adding all the user stories we have 
decided to complete to the icebox on pivotal tracker.

What will I do today? Today, I will continue to add tasks and user acceptance criteria
to the pivotal tracker so that we are aware of exactly what we need to complete

Is anything in my way? Some features that are allocated to me rely on interface 
components, since this is the first week of development and we are focusing more on
back-end to get up an running, this may impact my progress on the user stories as part
of sprint one.


## Weekly Meeting 2 (Sprint #1) - 14/10/19
Today, we held another weekly meeting for Sprint #1 to discuss the progress of everyone
and bring up any concerns we have. We decided to modify some architecture and enforce
some code styling techniques. 

What did I do yesterday? Yesterday, I worked on planning how I will tackle my assigned
user stories and began scoping what attributes the user class will require

What will I do today? Today, I will complete the user class, with appropriate functions
as well as implement test cases to ensure that the code works accordingly

Is anything in my way? The react/flask setup is slightly delayed due to other university
commitments which pushes draft UI creation a day further.
