## Meeting 1 (Sprint #1) - 9/10/19
Today, we held a weekly meeting to discuss the sprint that commenced today. The main 
objective of this meeting was to assign points to the user stories and determine which
stories are most important to focus on for Sprint #1. We decided to focus on user account
creation, event creation and database setup as these are the basis of other features. I
was assigned to work on user facing features with Michael.

What did I do yesterday? Yesterday, I worked on adding all the user stories we have 
decided to complete to the icebox on pivotal tracker.

What will I do today? Today, I will continue to add tasks and user acceptance criteria
to the pivotal tracker so that we are aware of exactly what we need to complete

Is anything in my way? Some features that are allocated to me rely on interface 
components, since this is the first week of development and we are focusing more on
back-end to get up an running, this may impact my progress on the user stories as part
of sprint one.


## Meeting 2 (Sprint #1) - 14/10/19
Today, we held another weekly meeting for Sprint #1 to discuss the progress of everyone
and bring up any concerns we have. We decided to modify some architecture and enforce
some code styling techniques. 

What did I do yesterday? Yesterday, I worked on planning how I will tackle my assigned
user stories and began scoping what attributes the user class will require

What will I do today? Today, I will complete the user class, with appropriate functions
as well as implement test cases to ensure that the code works accordingly

Is anything in my way? The react/flask setup is slightly delayed due to other university
commitments which pushes draft UI creation a day further. 


## Meeting 3 (Sprint #2) - 16/10/19
Today, we held a sprint review to discuss the success of Sprint #1 as well as planning
the following sprint that commences tmrw. We worked together to assign stories for the
backlog, assigned tasks and spoke about how to improve the agile process for Sprint #2. 

What did I do yesterday? Yesterday, I on checking and accepting the user stories as part
of Sprint #1 and added tasks to the user stories stages for Sprint #2. I also modified
the interface and created some additional screens to share with the team. I attached
these designs to the corresponding user story.

What will I do today? Today, I will add acceptance criteria to the stories in Sprint #2
and research DialogFlow so that I can complete the NLP user story for this sprint

Is anything in my way? Learning NLP before beginning to work on the user story might 
slow down my progress slightly. 


## Meeting 4 (Sprint #2) - 21/10/19
Today, we held a meeting to discuss the end of Sprint #2 as well as planning for the
following sprint. The team again, worked on assigning the user stories.

What did I do yesterday? Yesterday, I worked on setting up the Flask and React file
structure with Morgan.

What will I do today? Today, I will continue to work on setting up the Flask and React
so that the team and I are able to start creating the front end.

Is anything in my way? Lack of familiarity with Webpack (a resource that we are using)
to set up the file structure may be problematic.



## Meeting 5 (Sprint #3) - 23/10/19
Today, we held a sprint meeting to discuss the user stories we hope to tackle for this
new sprint and assigned tasks to everyone. Egene also updated the team on the progress
of the database so that everyone is on the same page, especially those working on the 
back0end of the application.

What did I do yesterday? Yesterday, I began setting up the calendar UI so that we have
a interface to play around with.

What will I do today? I will continue setting up the basic calendar UI and create acceptance
criteria for the user stories.

Is anything in my way? I am having some trouble with the React routing. I believe it has
something to do with the webpack configuration but I will continue to fix the BUG
which I have added to Pivotal Tracker.


## Meeting 6 (Sprint #3) - 28/10/19
Today, we met up to check the status of everyone regarding the progress on the user
stories and tasks. There was some confusion on how to store notifications and when 
notifications should be triggered for users. After some discussion, we arrived at a 
method that satisfied everyone and was user-focused too.

What did I do yesterday? Yesterday, I continued working on the monthly view and set
up buttons to use when the other calendar views are finished.

What will I do today? I will work on adding acceptance criteria and more tasks to 
Pivotal Tracker for the next sprint that will start tomorrow.

Is anything in my way? No.



## Meeting 7 (Sprint #4) - 30/10/19
Today, we held our sprint review with the class. We presented the calendar view and 
the login screens that were a part of the previous iterations. 

What did I do yesterday? Yesterday, I worked on creating a universal stylesheet to added.
I also imported the font styles and defined basic colours and headings so that the interface
is consistent. I also worked on the group contact back-end feature with Derrick.

What will I do today? Today, I will work onn organising the interface files as more team
members are going to jump on the front end portion of the application soon.

Is anything in my way? Today, we found a bug within the system. The interface was not 
rendering on other teammates computers. I suspect this is because some dependencies have
not been uploaded (from my end). 



## Meeting 8 (Sprint #4) - 4/11/19
Today, we held another meeting to discuss the progress of the database that Egene is in
charge of. We also discussed other questions team mates have regarding their assigned
user stories.

What did I do yesterday? Yesterday, I worked on creating tasks and user acceptance criteria
to the user stories that are upcoming in the next iteration.

What will I do today? Today, I will work on the schedule overview of events. The basic
structure of the interface for the schedule view is already created but requires some 
modifications that require some time.

Is anything in my way? No.
