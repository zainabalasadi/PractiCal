10/10/2019:
Started setting up the MySQL server. So far created the user table, and started
coding the manager functions for it.

11/10/2019:
Wrote and tested new methods to add, delete, and edit entries in the users
table.

13/10/2019:
Refactored code. Added events table to database, basing the schema off the
event class defined in the EventBranch branch. Also wrote creat/delete event
methods. New code not tested.

14/10/2019:
Refactored code. Added events update methods and fixed syntax errors in some
of the sql statements used in the code. Did some basic testing of some methods.

15-16/10/2019:
Refactored code. Finished writing basic getters/setters for events and users
tables. Also wrote a test script for all the methods.

21/10/2019:
Added invites table to represent status of invites users have received for
events. Updated getUser function to require an email and password to retrieve
user information. getUser and getEvent methods return a User and Event object
respectively.

28/10/2019:
Changed getter functions in DatabaseManager to return tuples again to simplify
the system. Added loadUser method to PracticalManager which loads a user and
their events and calendars into appropriate classes.

01/11/2019:
Pulled class definitions from master to my branch. Implemented login/logout
and database update methods in practicalManager. Once tested, can merge to
master for complete integration into frontend.

05/11/2019:
Added methods for handling invites and notifications to PractiCalManager and
did some tests on the updated database.

06/11/2019:
Added category and location fields to events table. Added addEvent method.
Refactoring and several bug fixes (mainly syntax errors). Tested code and
merged DatabaseIntegrationBranch with master.
