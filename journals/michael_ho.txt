Sprint 1: 9/10 - 15/10
- Completed "Create an account" user story with Zainab. In specific, 
I completed the creation of a user through the PractiCalManager and 
also the task of creating a default calendar for a new user.

- Completed "Adding invitees to events" user story. I created functions 
to searh for users in the Calendar Manager and to add invited events to 
a user's calendar. I also created methods for invited users to accept,
decline and maybe event invitations.

Sprint 2: 16/10 - 22/10
- Finished 5hrs+ long react tutorial

- Completed "Account access" user story with Derrick. In particular, I 
changed route decorators to work with flask blueprint. I implemented new 
user registration and saved details to a new user object. I also 
implemented flask_login to authenticate users and keep them in session.
In total, there is a login page, a register page, a forgot password page
and a calendar page for when users are logged in. I also made minor styling
edits.
