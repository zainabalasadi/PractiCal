Sprint 1: 9/10 - 15/10
- Completed "Create an account" user story with Zainab. In specific, 
I completed the creation of a user through the PractiCalManager and 
also the task of creating a default calendar for a new user.

- Completed "Adding invitees to events" user story. I created functions 
to searh for users in the Calendar Manager and to add invited events to 
a user's calendar. I also created methods for invited users to accept,
decline and maybe event invitations.
