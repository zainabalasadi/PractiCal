Sprint 1: 9/10 - 15/10
- Completed "Create an account" user story with Zainab. In specific, 
I completed the creation of a user through the PractiCalManager and 
also the task of creating a default calendar for a new user.

- Completed "Adding invitees to events" user story. I created functions 
to searh for users in the Calendar Manager and to add invited events to 
a user's calendar. I also created methods for invited users to accept,
decline and maybe event invitations.

Sprint 2: 16/10 - 22/10
- Finished 5hrs+ long react tutorial

- Completed "Account access" user story with Derrick. In particular, I 
changed route decorators to work with flask blueprint. I implemented new 
user registration and saved details to a new user object. I also 
implemented flask_login to authenticate users and keep them in session.
In total, there is a login page, a register page, a forgot password page
and a calendar page for when users are logged in. I also made minor styling
edits.

- Completed "Respond to event invitations" user story with Derrick. In
particular, I created the functionality to send the appropriate

included refactoring the notifications class to be able to hold different
types of notifications (not just invites).

Sprint 4: 30/10 - 5/11
- Started on the "Search for events in calendar" user story. Created the 
the search methods for searching by title and searching by host.

- Added several front end components. The navbar at the top was added
using material-ui components. The navbar includes the 'PractiCal' name,
a search bar, notifications icon and an account/profile icon. As this is
my first time using react I struggled a bit with this task and some loose
ends still need to be fixed.

- Fixed bugs on front-end and back-end to load events from database. This
involved refactoring code views.py which contians our endpoints.

now search by title or host and a list of matching events appear in a 
dialog box.

- Added an error message to pop-up if invalid start and end times are 
entered when creating events.

- Fixed bugs which caused the app to crash if the view mode was changed
after creating an event.
